## Quick Start: Running C++ Programs in VS Code

1. **Requirements**
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [C/C++ extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
   - C++ compiler:
     - Windows: [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) or similar
     - Linux: `g++` (install via your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt install g++`)

2. **Open the Folder**
   - Use `File > Open Folder...` in VS Code to open this repository.

3. **Build and Run**
   - Open a `.cpp` file.
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build (uses the provided build task).
   - Run the generated `.exe` from the terminal, or use the Run/Debug options.

4. **Manual Compilation**
   - In the terminal (Windows):
     ```sh
     g++ filename.cpp -o output.exe
     ./output.exe
     ```
   - In the terminal (Linux):
     ```sh
     g++ filename.cpp -o output
     ./output
     ```

5. **Notes**
   - Most programs require input/output via the terminal.
   - Ensure your compiler (g++) is installed and in your system PATH.
   - For troubleshooting, check the Problems tab or terminal output.
